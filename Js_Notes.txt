Var, Const and Let keyword ki khani:------

    Const - Const keyword is used for only constant and not change/redeclare anywhere in the code.
    Let -   var keyword is used for anywhere but it can be redeclare within the function.
    Var-    Let keyword is used for anywhere but it can be redeclare within the function, It is not use in industry beacuse
            it access from anywhere.

    Note: we declare a variable without any keyword.
        example: shopname=" GymStore ";

Data Types ki khani............

    Most used Data Types.
    1.Number    - 8471
    2.String    - "ashish"
    3.boolean   - true/false
    4.bigInt    - use for large Integer.
    5.null      - standalone value.

    note: null means that something declare a value.it is treated as object.
    undefined - undefined means that nothing is decalare. it is treated as undefined only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversion ki khani............

    we have Integer variable number to change to string boolean and many...

    33-number to string then change but it give result (`NaN`)-Not any Number.
    same in all datatypes.

String pe Charche.................

    ->There are two Method of Creating a string.

        1.String Primitive  => const str1= " Primitive String".
                            At index 0 at prsent " Primitive String".

        2.String Object    => const str1= new String("A String object").
                            At index 0 at present 'A'
                            At index 1 at present ' '
                            At index 2 at present 'S'
                                      .
                                      .
                                      .
                                    show on  

        Note: we use only string primitive Conversioni is better.

        function of String
        -------------------
            1.charAt()  -   It used finding in which index present at what character.
                            charAt(index)-synatx

            2.indexOf() -   It is used to finding the charcter at what index presnet.
                            indexOf(searchString)  indexOf(searchString, position)

            3.concat()  - It is used to concatation between N string.
                            concat(str1, str2, /* â€¦, */ strN)

            4.slice()   - It is used to slice the string. it also start with negative number.
                            slice(indexStart, indexEnd).

            5.repeat()  - Repeatation purpose use
                            repeat(count)

            Note: Many function are in string like trim, touppercase,tolowercase ..etc.
